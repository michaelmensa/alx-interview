N Queens Solver

Usage: nqueens N
If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments,
print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line,
and exit with the status 1
If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line,
and exit with the status 1
The program should print every possible solution to the problem
One solution per line
Format: see example
You donâ€™t have to print the solutions in a specific order
You are only allowed to import the sys module
Read: Queen, Backtracking
