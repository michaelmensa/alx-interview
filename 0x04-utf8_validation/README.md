# UTF-8 Validation

## Method Description

The task at hand is to implement a method, `validUTF8(data)`, that determines whether a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The prototype of the method is as follows:

```python
def validUTF8(data):
    # Implementation logic here
    # Return True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else return False
```

## Specifications

- **Return Value:**
  THe method should return `True` if the provided data is a valid UTF-8 encoding;
  otherwise `False`

## Implementation Guidelines

The UTF-8 encoding uses a variable-length format, where the number of bytes used to represent a character depends on the character itself. The method should follow these guidelines:

1. **Start Byte Detection:**
   Identify the start byThe method should return `True` if the provided data is a valid UTF-8 encoding; otherwise, it should return `False`.

- **Character Length:**
  In UTF-8, a character can be 1 to 4 bytes long. The validation should consider this range while processing the given data set.

- **Data Representation:**
  The input data set is represented by a list of integers. Each integer represents 1 byte of data. Therefore, during validation, only the 8 least significant bits of each integer need to be considered.

## Implements of each character in the data set. In UTF-8, the start byte of a character has specific bit patterns.

2. **Character Length Determination:**
   Based on the bit patterns of the start byte, determine the length of the character (number of bytes used to represent the character).

3. **Validation:**
   Validate that the following bytes in the character have the correct bit pattern to ensure a valid UTF-8 encoding.

4. **Handling Invalid Sequences:**
   If an invalid sequence is encountered during validation, return `False`.

5. **End of Data:**
   Ensure that the method handles the end of the data set appropriately.

## Example

Consider the following example:

```python
data = [197, 130, 1]  # Represents the UTF-8 encoding of a character
result = validUTF8(data)
print(result)  # Should print True
```

In this example, the provided data represents a valid UTF-8 encoding, and the method should return `True`.

This description provides a clear understanding of the task, specifications, and implementation guidelines for validating a given data set as a UTF-8 encoding.
