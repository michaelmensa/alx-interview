Log parsing is the process of analyzing log files generated by software applications, servers, or systems to extract meaningful information. In the context of the provided input format, the goal is to process log entries containing details such as IP address, date, HTTP request, status code, and file size.

Here's a simple example of a script in Python that reads input line by line and computes some basic metrics. In this case, we'll calculate the total file size and count the number of occurrences of each status code:

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def parse_log_line(line):
    # Sample log entry: 127.0.0.1 - [2023-01-01] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" 200 1024
    parts = line.split()
    ip_address = parts[0]
    status_code = int(parts[-2])
    file_size = int(parts[-1])
    return ip_address, status_code, file_size

def process_logs():
    total_file_size = 0
    status_code_counts = defaultdict(int)

    for line in sys.stdin:
        ip_address, status_code, file_size = parse_log_line(line)
        total_file_size += file_size
        status_code_counts[status_code] += 1

    return total_file_size, status_code_counts

if __name__ == "__main__":
    total_size, status_counts = process_logs()

    print(f"Total File Size: {total_size} bytes")

    print("\nStatus Code Counts:")
    for code, count in status_counts.items():
        print(f"{code}: {count} occurrences")
```

This script defines a `parse_log_line` function to extract relevant information from each log entry. The `process_logs` function reads from standard input (stdin) line by line, processes the log entries, and calculates the total file size and status code counts.

To use this script, you can redirect the content of a log file or provide log entries via the command line. For example:

```bash
cat your_log_file.log | python log_parser.py
```

Or, if you have log entries in a file called `log_entries.txt`:

```bash
python log_parser.py < log_entries.txt
```

This script provides a basic example, and depending on your specific requirements, you may want to extend it to compute additional metrics or handle more complex log entry formats.
