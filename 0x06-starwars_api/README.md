# Star Wars Movie Character Script

## Overview
The script is designed to retrieve and print all character names from a specific Star Wars movie using the Star Wars API. It takes the Movie ID as the first positional argument, and the output displays one character name per line in the same order as the "characters" list in the `/films/` endpoint.

## Requirements
- Python script using the `request` module to interact with the Star Wars API.
- The first positional argument specifies the Movie ID (e.g., 3 for "Return of the Jedi").

## Script Execution
The script can be executed from the command line, passing the Movie ID as an argument. For example:

```bash
python star_wars_script.py 3
```

This command fetches information about the movie with ID 3 ("Return of the Jedi") and prints the names of the characters in the order provided by the API.

## Implementation
1. The script starts by importing the necessary modules, including the `requests` module for making HTTP requests.
2. It defines a function that takes the Movie ID as an argument and sends a GET request to the Star Wars API's `/films/` endpoint to retrieve information about the specified movie.
3. The script extracts the "characters" list from the API response, which contains URLs for each character in the movie.
4. For each character URL, another GET request is made to retrieve detailed information about the character, including their name.
5. The script then prints each character name, one per line, maintaining the order provided by the API.

## Example Output
Assuming the Movie ID is 3 (for "Return of the Jedi"), the script's output would look like:

```
Luke Skywalker
Han Solo
Princess Leia Organa
...
```

This output displays the names of characters from the specified Star Wars movie in the order they appear in the API's "characters" list.

## Error Handling
The script includes error handling to manage potential issues, such as invalid Movie IDs or connection problems with the Star Wars API. Error messages are displayed to provide feedback in case of any problems.
